# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Project Goals

This project is tailored to enhance expertise in modern software development practices. By completing this project, learners will:

* Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
* Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
* Implement advanced security measures for API development.
* Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
* Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
* Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Technology Stack

The primary technologies used in this project will include:

* **Backend Framework:** Django
* **Database:** MySQL
* **API:** GraphQL, REST APIs
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Containerization:** Docker (optional, but recommended for CI/CD)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or similar platforms)
* **Frontend:** (To be determined - could be React, Vue, Angular, or server-side rendered Django templates) - *Initially, the focus is on backend development.*
